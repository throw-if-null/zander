    Domain-level state store contract for the Svelte 5 Zander app.
    Describes operations on the in-memory State (bookmarks, categories,
    view state) and how they interact with the PersistenceBackend.

# NOTE:
# - Core domain types (Bookmark, Category, State, ExportBundle, PersistenceError)
#   are defined in `spec/persistence.backend.yaml` and referenced here by name.

  StateStore:
    description: >
      Abstract interface for the domain-level state store used by the Svelte
      app. Implemented on top of a Svelte store and a configured
      PersistenceBackend, but the contract is agnostic to Svelte specifics.

    operations:
      loadInitialState:
        description: >
          Load initial State from the configured PersistenceBackend. If no
          persisted data exists, initialize with built-in defaults. Ensures
          basic invariants (valid category references, sane view state).
        input: null
        output:
          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "Calls PersistenceBackend.loadState()."
          - "If null is returned, constructs a default State in memory."
          - "Ensures currentCategoryId, currentView, and currentSettingsPage are valid."

      setCurrentCategory:
        description: >
          Change the currently selected category. Updates State.currentCategoryId
          and persists the new view state.
        input:
          type: object
          fields:
            categoryId:
              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: >
                Desired category id, or null for 'All' categories.
        output:
          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "If categoryId is non-null but not found, falls back to the first root category id or null."
          - "Calls PersistenceBackend.saveState() after updating state."

      addCategory:
        description: >
          Create a new Category under the specified parent (or as a root
          category when parentId is null). Assigns id and createdAt, and
          chooses an initial color.
        input:
          type: object
          fields:
            parentId:
              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: >
                Parent category id, or null to add a root category.
            name:
              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: >
                Optional display name. If null, a default template name is used.
        output:
          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "If parentId is null, appends to State.categories."
          - "If parentId is non-null but not found, treats it as null (root insert)."
          - "Uses generateUUID() for id and calculateStardate() for createdAt."
          - "Color may default to a theme-appropriate value or inherit from parent."

      moveCategory:
        description: >
          Reorder a category among its siblings. Moving 'up' swaps with the
          previous sibling; moving 'down' swaps with the next sibling.
        input:
          type: object
          fields:

        output:
          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "If categoryId is not found, State is unchanged."
          - "If already at the first/last position, State is unchanged."
          - "Movement never changes parent; only sibling order."

      deleteCategory:
        description: >
          Delete a category and its entire subtree. All bookmarks whose
          categoryId lies in that subtree are also deleted. View state is
          adjusted if it pointed into the removed subtree.
        input:
          type: object
          fields:
            categoryId:
              type: string
        output:

        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "If categoryId is not found, State is unchanged."
          - "All descendant categories are removed from the tree."
          - "All bookmarks referencing any removed category are deleted."
          - "If currentCategoryId pointed into the subtree, it is reset to a safe default (first root or null)."

      addBookmark:
        description: >
          Create a new Bookmark assigned to the given category (or current
          category by default). Assigns id and createdAt, and normalizes the URL.

              nullable: true
              description: >

                a default root category.
            description:
              type: string | null
              required: false

          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "Uses generateUUID() for id and calculateStardate() for createdAt."
          - "Normalizes url using normalizeUrl()."
          - "If effective category id is not found, falls back to a default root category or creates one as needed."

      updateBookmark:
        description: >
          Update an existing Bookmark's fields (title, url, description,
          categoryId). Does not change createdAt.

              nullable: true

              nullable: true
              description: >

              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: >

      resetSystem:
        description: >
          Reset the app to its default data bundle. Clears any persisted data
          from the active PersistenceBackend and reinitializes State with
          defaults (bookmarks, categories, and view state).
        input: null
        output:
          type: State
        errors:
          - PersistenceError
        notes:
          - "Equivalent to clearing storage keys for the active backend and loading defaults."
          - "After reset, currentCategoryId, currentView, and currentSettingsPage are set to their initial values."

      applyExportBundle:
        description: >
          Replace the current State with the contents of an imported ExportBundle
          (e.g., from PersistenceBackend.importData or a user-chosen file).
          Performs validation and normalization similar to the legacy app.

          - "Valid bookmarks are kept; invalid ones are discarded."
          - "Structurally valid categories are kept; invalid ones are discarded."
          - "Category colors outside the LCARS palette may be normalized rather than rejected."
          - "Import is treated as a full overwrite of bookmarks and categories."

scenarios:
  delete_category_cascades_bookmarks:
    description: >
      Deleting a category removes its subtree and all bookmarks in that
      subtree, and keeps State invariants intact.
    given:
      - "State S with categories [root, child] where child is nested under root."
      - "Bookmarks b1 in root, b2 in child, and b3 in an unrelated category."
    when:
      - "S2 = deleteCategory({ categoryId: child.id })"
    then:
      - "S2.categories no longer contains child or any of its descendants."
      - "S2.bookmarks does not contain b2, but still contains b1 and b3."
      - "If S.currentCategoryId pointed into the deleted subtree, S2.currentCategoryId is reset to a safe value."

  move_category_only_reorders_siblings:
    description: >
      Moving a category up or down only changes its position among siblings,
      not its parent or subtree.
    given:
      - "State S with root categories [A, B, C] and B having a child D."
    when:
      - "S2 = moveCategory({ categoryId: B.id, direction: 'up' })"
    then:
      - "Root order is [B, A, C] in S2."
      - "B's parent is still root in S2."
      - "B's child D remains attached to B in S2."

  reset_system_restores_defaults:
    description: >
      resetSystem clears persisted data and restores default bookmarks,
      categories, and view state.
    given:
      - "State S with user-modified bookmarks and categories already saved."
    when:
      - "S2 = resetSystem()"
    then:
      - "S2.bookmarks and S2.categories match the default bundle (up to allowed variations like createdAt)."
      - "S2.currentCategoryId, S2.currentView, and S2.currentSettingsPage are the initial defaults."
      - "Subsequent loadInitialState() observes the reset state, not S."

  apply_export_bundle_overwrites_state:
    description: >
      Applying an ExportBundle overwrites existing bookmarks and categories,
      subject to validation and normalization rules.
    given:
      - "An initial State S1 with some bookmarks and categories."
      - "An ExportBundle B produced from a different valid State S2."
    when:
      - "S_after = applyExportBundle(B)"
    then:
      - "S_after.bookmarks and S_after.categories match those of S2 (subject to normalization)."
      - "No bookmarks or categories from S1 remain unless they are also present in S2."
      - "State invariants (valid category references, etc.) are preserved."
