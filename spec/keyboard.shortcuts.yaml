    Keyboard shortcut behavior for the Svelte 5 Zander app. Derived from the
    legacy single-file implementation but adapted for SPA context.

shortcuts:
  alt_h_home:
    combo: "Alt+H"
    description: "Go Home (Bookmarks view)."
    when:
      - "No text input, textarea, or select element has focus."
    effect:
      - "Switches to the Bookmarks view."
      - "Closes any open dialog if appropriate."

  alt_b_add_bookmark:
    combo: "Alt+B"
    description: "Open Add Bookmark dialog."
    when:
      - "No text input, textarea, or select element has focus."
    effect:
      - "Opens BookmarkDialog in create mode."

  alt_s_settings:
    combo: "Alt+S"
    description: "Switch to Settings view."
    when:
      - "No text input, textarea, or select element has focus."
    effect:
      - "Switches to Settings view."
      - "Optionally restores the last active settings sub-page."

  alt_c_add_category:
    combo: "Alt+C"
    description: "Open Add Category flow."
    when:
      - "No text input, textarea, or select element has focus."
    effect:
      - "Triggers the add-category action (e.g. opens a category creation UI)."

  esc_close_dialogs:
    combo: "Esc"
    description: "Close open dialogs or revert to primary view."
    effect:
      - "If any modal dialog is open, closes the top-most dialog."
      - "If no dialogs are open, may be ignored or used to revert to primary view depending on context."

  enter_submit_dialog:
    combo: "Enter"
    description: "Submit the active dialog form."
    when:
      - "Focus is inside a dialog form and not on a multi-line input control."
    effect:
      - "Triggers the dialog's submit/confirm action."

notes:
  - "Shortcuts are implemented via a single keydown listener at the App or document level."
  - "Handlers must check focus context to avoid interfering with text entry."
  - "Dialog-specific keyboard handling (Esc/Enter) is wired within dialog components as well, consistent with ACCESSIBILITY.md."
