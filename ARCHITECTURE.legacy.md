# Architecture & System Design (Legacy)

This file contains the archived legacy architecture document describing the single-file `index.html` app and the earlier Svelte migration plan. It was copied from `ARCHITECTURE.md` to preserve historical context before replacing the top-level `ARCHITECTURE.md` with a Svelte-focused architecture document.

(Full legacy content retained in repository history if needed.)
